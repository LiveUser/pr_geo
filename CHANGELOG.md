## version 0.0.2+1

- Forget about what version 0.0.1+1 says
- Entirely rewritten the library but kept its API so that old code doesn't break
- Accepts any angle for latitude and longitude because it will always find the corresponding angle and adjust the longitude accordingly
- Added one more example
- Still using the rounded MeanSea level found online send me an email with scientific references if you got a better one
- Added the Technical Specifications to the readme.md to try to give an insight on the basics of latitude and longitude.
- Tested the library a bit more and its better than before. Now its usable.
- Added some random Personal thoughts/Story related to the method itself.

## version 0.0.1+1

- Package created and tested
- Accepts lat and long values ranging from -360 degrees to 360 degrees
- Its decent enough for publishing
